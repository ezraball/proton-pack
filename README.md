Jwir3's Proton Pack
================================
A suite of tools designed to assist programmers with mundane, everyday tasks.

Contents
---------------------------------
The basic structure of the pack is organized by language used to construct the
tool. Most of the tools are written in Python, but there are a few shell scripts
and other items in the pack.

List of tools:
- __branchhealth.py__: A tool for determining which branches within a git
repository can be safely pruned.
- __genregression.py__: Based off of http://github.com/mozilla/mozregression. A
tool to determine the first binary in a set of binaries that a regression was
found within.
- __idfreshener__: An Eclipse plugin designed to freshen (re-generate) serial
version ID member variables of classes that implement Serializable.
